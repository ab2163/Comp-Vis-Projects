# MNIST_Example.py
Gives code for a regular dense neural network which was trained to identify handwritten digits from MNIST dataset.

# Backpropagation Equations Derivation
Gives derivation of backpropagation equations (from first principles) for neural network used for MNIST classification task.

# DogsVsCats.py
Gives code for CNN used to classify images of cats and dogs.

# KangarooCNN.py
Gives code for CNN which was trained to classify between images of kangaroos and background images using VGG16 baseline model.

# DetectKangaroo.py
Gives code for R-CNN (using CNN obtained from KangarooCNN.py) used to detect images of kangaroos with bounding boxes (i.e. object detection) using selective search and non-maxima suppression.
